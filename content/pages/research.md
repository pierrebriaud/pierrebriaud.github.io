# Research interests


So far, my PhD and post-doctoral research have focused on algebraic cryptanalysis, applied to both public-key and secret-key schemes.

My work in public-key cryptography mainly concerns code-based and multivariate schemes, two major families believed to be resistant to quantum attacks. Much of this research has been motivated by the [NIST post-quantum standardization process](https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/post-quantum-cryptography). 

I started working on secret-key cryptanalysis near the end of my PhD. Algebraic attacks currently play a central role in the analysis of so-called arithmetization-oriented primitives, symmetric constructions designed for integration into advanced cryptographic protocols (for an accurate introduction to this topic, see this [webpage](https://stap-zoo.com/) or these [slides](https://indico.math.cnrs.fr/event/11948/attachments/5546/9674/0_Leo_Perrin.pdf)).
