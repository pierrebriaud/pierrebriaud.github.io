Since January 2024, I am a post-doctoral researcher in the Cryptography department of [Simula UiB](https://simula-uib.com/). I am interested in algebraic cryptanalysis, applied to various constructions.

From October 2020 to December 2023, I was a PhD student in the [COSMIQ project-team](https://www.rocq.inria.fr/secret/index-en.html) of Inria Paris, under the supervision of [Jean-Pierre Tillich](https://www.rocq.inria.fr/secret/Jean-Pierre.Tillich/).
